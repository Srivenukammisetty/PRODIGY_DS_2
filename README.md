# PRODIGY_DS_2
Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing irrelevant columns. Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions and correlations. Created heatmaps and pair plots to identify patterns and relationships between variables. Documented the process and findings for future reference and reproducibility.
